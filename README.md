# Wiki

A fast offline wiki for personal notes, running on Node JS.


## Installation Guide
1. Install NodeJS.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Move to your wiki.
4. Install necessary components with `npm install` or by running `setup.bat`.
5. Start the wiki with `npm start` or by running `start.bat`. If you are on Mac OS or Linux, execute `start.sh` (you may have to change the port manually if you changed it in the wiki. If you add `cd path\to\wiki` to the top of `start.sh` and `npmstart.sh`, you can put the two files somewhere where your `PATH` can reach them, to start your Wiki from anywhere).
6. Wiki is now available under `localhost:3000` or whatever port is set in the `config.js` file.

## Configuration
1. Open `config.js`.
2. Adjust values.

or use the Settings page of the wiki.
